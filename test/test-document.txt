# Test Document for Binary Diff System

This is a test document to demonstrate the binary diff functionality.

## Version 1 Content
- Initial paragraph with some content
- A few bullet points to test diff detection
- Some basic formatting and structure

## Features to Test
1. Minor changes (typos, small additions)
2. Major changes (new sections, reorganization) 
3. Structural changes (complete rewrites)

The binary diff system will analyze changes between versions and provide:
- Change categorization (MINOR, MAJOR, STRUCTURAL)
- Percentage of content changed
- Similarity scores between versions
- Compression ratios achieved by the diff algorithm

This content provides a good baseline for testing version differences.
