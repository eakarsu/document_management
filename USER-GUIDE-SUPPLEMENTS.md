## 💡 Pro Tips for Users

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**
   - Don't try to supplement everything at once
   - Focus on critical sections first

2. **Use Clear Rationales**
   ```
   ❌ Bad: "Local requirement"
   ✅ Good: "Average temperature of 95°F requires moisture-wicking uniforms"
   ```

3. **Follow the Hierarchy**
   - Number your sections to match the parent
   - Use consistent formatting

4. **Think "More Restrictive"**
   - You can ADD requirements
   - You can't REMOVE parent requirements
   - You can CLARIFY but not contradict

### Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Climate Adaptations
**Parent says:** "Wear appropriate uniform"
**You add:** "In tropical locations, moisture-wicking undergarments required"
**Action:** ADD
**Rationale:** "High humidity averaging 85% year-round"

#### Scenario 2: Local Procedures
**Parent says:** "Report within 72 hours"
**You modify:** "Report within 24 hours with preliminary assessment"
**Action:** MODIFY
**Rationale:** "Typhoon season requires faster response times"

#### Scenario 3: Not Applicable
**Parent says:** "Cold weather procedures"
**You delete:** Mark entire section
**Action:** DELETE
**Rationale:** "Tropical location - no cold weather"
