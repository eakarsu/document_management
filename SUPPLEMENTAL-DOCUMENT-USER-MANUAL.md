## üéØ Overview

Supplemental documents allow military organizations at different command levels to add location-specific or unit-specific guidance to base documents without modifying the original. This ensures local requirements are met while maintaining the integrity of higher-level directives.

### Key Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **Preserve Original**: Base documents remain unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Local Flexibility**: Commands can address unique requirements
- ‚úÖ **Clear Hierarchy**: Higher directives always take precedence
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: All supplements are tracked and attributed
- ‚úÖ **Easy Updates**: Supplements can be modified independently

---

## üìã What are Supplemental Documents?

Supplemental documents are official additions to base military publications that:
- Add local implementation guidance
- Clarify procedures for specific locations
- Include additional requirements (more restrictive only)
- Address unique environmental or operational factors

### Example:
- **Base Document**: AFI 36-2903 (Dress and Appearance)
- **MAJCOM Supplement**: AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP (Pacific-specific requirements)
- **Base Supplement**: AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_KADENAAB (Kadena-specific additions)

---

## üèõÔ∏è Authority Hierarchy

Supplements follow a strict hierarchical structure:

```
Level 1: Service Level (Air Force)
    ‚Üì Can supplement
Level 2: MAJCOM (Major Command)
    ‚Üì Can supplement
Level 3: Wing/Base
    ‚Üì Can supplement
Level 4: Squadron/Unit
```

### Important Rules:
1. **Lower levels CANNOT contradict higher levels**
2. **Can be MORE restrictive, never LESS**
3. **Must comply with all parent document requirements**
4. **Each level inherits all higher-level supplements**

---

## üöÄ Creating a Supplement

## ‚úèÔ∏è Editing Supplement Content

### Initial Template Structure

When you create a supplement, you'll see:

1. **üìã Guidelines Box** (Blue)
   - Shows document name and metadata
   - Displays your authority level
   - Lists the supplement type

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Rules Box** (Orange)

   - Shows proper numbering
   - Includes rationale sections

### üéØ NEW: Section Marking Feature

The system now includes an **advanced section marking tool** that allows you to visually mark and annotate specific text sections within your supplement document.

#### How to Mark Sections:

1. **Select Text**: Highlight any text in your supplement document that you want to mark
2. **Floating Toolbar**: A floating toolbar will appear with 4 action buttons:
   - üü¢ **Add** (Green plus icon) - For new content
   - üü† **Modify** (Orange edit icon) - For modifications
   - üîµ **Replace** (Blue swap icon) - For replacements
   - üî¥ **Delete** (Red trash icon) - For deletions

3. **Click Action**: Choose the appropriate action for your supplement
4. **Fill Dialog**: A dialog will open asking for:
   - **Parent Section Number** (Required): e.g., "2.3.1"
   - **Parent Section Title** (Optional): e.g., "Dress Standards"
   - **Rationale** (Required): Why this supplement is needed
   - The selected text is shown for reference

5. **Save**: Click "Mark Section" to apply the marking

#### Visual Indicators:

Once marked, the text will show:
- üü¢ **Green highlight** with underline for ADDITIONS
- üü† **Orange highlight** with underline for MODIFICATIONS
- üîµ **Blue highlight** with underline for REPLACEMENTS
- üî¥ **Red strikethrough** with reduced opacity for DELETIONS

**Hover** over any marked text to see:
- The action type and organization
- The rationale for the change

#### Marked Sections Sidebar:

A floating sidebar appears on the right showing:
- Total count of marked sections
- List of all marked sections with:
  - Action icon and section number
  - Action type and organization
  - Rationale for each change

#### Tips for Effective Marking:

1. **Be Specific**: Select only the exact text that needs supplementation
2. **Clear Rationale**: Provide detailed justification for each mark
3. **Consistent Numbering**: Use the same section numbering as the parent document
4. **Review Marks**: Check the sidebar to ensure all marks are correct

### Adding Your Content (Traditional Method)

#### Format for New Sections (ADD):
```
2.3.1.1 (Added-PACAF) Tropical Uniform Requirements
Personnel assigned to PACAF installations in tropical locations must:
- Wear moisture-wicking undergarments
- Carry additional hydration
Rationale: High humidity and temperature requirements
```

#### Format for Modifications (MODIFY):
```
3.1.2 (Modified-PACAF) Reporting Timeline
In addition to standard 72-hour reporting, PACAF units must:
- Submit preliminary report within 24 hours
- Include weather impact assessment
Rationale: Typhoon season operational requirements
```

#### Format for Replacements (REPLACE):
```
4.2.1 (Replaced-PACAF) Communication Procedures
[Original section replaced]
New procedure: Use PACAF Form 123 instead of AF Form 456
Rationale: Theater-specific communication requirements
```

#### Format for Deletions (DELETE):
```
5.3.2 (Deleted-PACAF) Cold Weather Procedures
This section does not apply to PACAF installations.
Rationale: Tropical climate eliminates cold weather concerns
```

### Numbering Convention

Always use:
1. Parent section number (e.g., "2.3.1")
2. Your sub-number if adding (e.g., ".1")
3. Action indicator (e.g., "Added-PACAF")

Example: `2.3.1.1 (Added-PACAF)`

Bad: "2.3.1.1 Additional Requirements"
```

### 2. Provide Context
Explain why the supplement is needed:
```
Good: "Rationale: Average temperature exceeds 95¬∞F for 6 months"
Bad: "Rationale: Local requirement"
```

### 3. Be Specific
Reference your unique conditions:
```
Good: "Due to proximity to ocean (within 500m)..."
Bad: "Due to local conditions..."
```

### 4. Maintain Consistency
Use the same format throughout:
- Same action tags (Added-ORG, Modified-ORG)
- Consistent numbering depth
- Uniform rationale placement

### 5. Regular Review

- Remove obsolete supplements
- Update for changing conditions
