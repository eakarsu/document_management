  Key Integration Points

  Authentication Flow:

  1. User logs in → receives JWT tokens
  2. authTokenService stores tokens in localStorage
  3. All API calls use authenticated fetch with automatic token refresh
  4. 401 responses trigger token refresh or redirect to login

  Document Creation Flow:

  1. User clicks "Create Document" from dashboard or documents page
  2. Template selection populates document sections
  3. Form submission creates document via /api/documents/create
  4. Success redirects to document details page

  8-Stage Workflow Integration:

  1. Workflow state stored in document.customFields.workflow
  2. EightStageWorkflowService manages state transitions
  3. Frontend displays current stage and available actions
  4. ICU feedback collected and stored in workflow metadata

  Test Accounts Available:

  Richmond DMS (20 accounts):
  - admin1@richmondDMS.com / password123 (ADMIN)
  - opr1@richmondDMS.com / password123 (OPR)
  - author1@richmondDMS.com / password123 (AUTHOR)
  - etc.

  Military .mil (20 accounts):
  - admin.colonel@af.mil / admin123 (Col Jane Smith)
  - opr.chief@af.mil / opr123 (Lt Col John Smith)
  - author.captain@af.mil / author123 (Capt Sarah Johnson)
  - etc.

  The system now has restored document creation functionality with template selection and the 8-stage workflow system is
  operational.
